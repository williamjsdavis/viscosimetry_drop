# Viscosometry Drop
An experimenting suite for ball drop viscosometry experiments.

Created by William Davis.

# Motivation

I used this code in 2020 for the class EPS 290 Computational Fluid Dynamics taught by Professor Bruce Buffett at UC Berkeley.
See motivation here...

# Using this code

Script and notebook examples can be found in the `examples/` directory. 

# Results

Previously, I conducted a series of viscosometry experiments at a fixed viscosity of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu=10^{-2}\text{&space;Pa&space;s}) and varied the radius of the sphere dropped. The terminal velocity varies as follows.

Additionally, I fixed the ball radius and varied the viscosity

# Future work

- [ ] Expand to 3D simulations.
- [ ] Explore fluids of different viscosities.
  -[ ] E.g. silicate melts.
- [ ] Explicitally model the time dependence of temperature in the experiment.
